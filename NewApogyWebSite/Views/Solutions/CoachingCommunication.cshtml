        <p>
            As the world becomes more automated, it’s important to remember the value of live mentorship from someone who’s been there. Apogy provides the tools a coach needs to artfully manage the development of their team. Apogy empowers coaches and mentors with live peer-to-peer mentoring sessions and interactive presentation tools.

            Coaches are completely accessible to their teams, even if they’re across the country. Connect through live video chat, either one-on-one or in small groups. Apogy allows coaches to share learning materials and presentations, with interactive features such allowing team members to interject, ask questions and even send real time messages.
