        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            Regions matter: The way we work is affected by region in which we live, work walk and talk. Today many organizations struggle with delivering consistent learning strategy, and simply don’t have the proper tools and resources to support the real-time shifts in regional business strategy. Without the proper tools, it’s a challenge to deliver employees relevant messaging, learning materials, as well as access to the thoughts leaders in their region.
