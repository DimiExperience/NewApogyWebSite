        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
Every event has a different app, and they all work differently.  Lead scanning, agendas, content, and schedule are always an extraordinary amount of work, and it never seems to get easier. How do you empower your sales team without forcing them to constantly switch between apps? How do you put all the event information, from team profiles to key materials and available meeting rooms, at their fingertips? How do you manage the flow of the event and what sales teams see when they consult their phones? And most importantly, how do you make the event smarter, from polling, Q&A sessions, training, certifications, to team challenges and ultimately, successfully launching your team and your products?
