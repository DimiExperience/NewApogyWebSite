        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Apogy’s secure and scalable Cloud based architecture and high degree of configurability drives rapid implementation of the system for our clients. We work as partners creating well defined requirements and establishing clear communication channels to ensure our client’s success.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apogy’s project manager works closely with the client team throughout implementation guiding the project forward, managing key handoffs and communicating expectations. This collaborative approach is supported by the documentation including communication and escalation plans, meeting and delivery Schedules and action lists clearly denoting roles and responsibilities.
