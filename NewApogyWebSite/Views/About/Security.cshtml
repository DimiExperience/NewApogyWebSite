        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Apogy is a secure Cloud hosted SaaS application, administered through a responsive Web based portal and delivered as a HTML 5 and and Native iOS application. All client data is encrypted and housed in a Virtual Private Network utilizing role based access to all resource utilizing the services provided by enterprise scale hosting infrastructure. In addition, all data transmission both within the network and with the clients is secured over HTTPS and TLS connections.

            <h2>Physical and Logical Security</h2>
            <p>
Apogy is committed to secure in our corporate and cloud services environments. Access to the corporate Apogy environment requires a key card that is acquired by employees and contractors during the on-boarding process.  The access list for these key cards are managed by the Apogy IT department.  All perimeter access requires valid key cards to gain entry.
        <p>
                Network Security is Achieved Through the use of layered firewalls, advanced Network Design and Network segmentation. High-availability firewalls are used to filter traffic between the web, application and data tiers. Firewalls support deep packet stateful inspection, dropping of anomalous packets, DOS protection, spoofing monitoring, and anti-virus filtering. Apogy networks have been designed to support vLAN and subnet segmentation, port restrictions, Access Control Lists, and Address and Port Translation. All physical connections are configured in a data high availability mesh topology, with each system and service having not less than two routes for communications. Apogy’s Network Communications mesh Assures Integrity and uninterrupted flow of data across our networks. Apogy firewalls are configured consistent with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards, and connections to all end -points reinforce our “least permissive” policy. All security devices and firewalls are monitored 24/7/365. Monitors are defined to trigger alerts when predefined thresholds are exceeded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data in transit and at rest are encrypted to provide optimal security. Data in transit is encrypted using secure socket layer (TLS) transmissions. Data volumes are encrypted in the production cloud services environment to ensure against any unwarranted access to customer information as it passes through Apogy. Authentication data such as username and passwords will always be encrypted at-rest and in-transit within and without the Apogy application. Apogy uses double encryption (at-rest and in-transit). All data in transit is encrypted. All communication with Apogy servers goes over HTTPS/SSL. The enabled protocols are TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 and the enabled ciphers are the ones recommended by the latest high security settings. For data at-rest identity information (passwords) uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. Antivirus software is installed on all servers to check and isolate or remove any viruses including data, attachments, etc. Systems are configured to scan for malicious software and infected files on a regular basis. New files are automatically scanned upon save or download including email attachments. Updates to virus databases are downloaded automatically and distributed through an automated update process. For attachments, customers should still maintain virus download protection in place to prevent any virus infection from that vector.

        <h2>Access Control</h2>
        <p>
            Apogy designs and manages all access into the Apogy cloud services environment as per the access management procedure. Third party firewall technology is deployed at our perimeter to guard against unauthorized access and access to these devices is controlled via access control lists that are maintained by select resources in our operations organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            All communication is restricted to HTTP and HTTPS (ports 80 and 443) all other access are denied.  An intrusion prevention system is deployed to alert SAAS operations of unauthorized attempts to access the cloud services environment. Application tiers that support the cloud services environment are segmented and to provide further security against unrestricted access.
        </p>
        <p>
            Access to the Apogy cloud services environment by internal Apogy resources is strictly controlled and based upon roles.  Request for access are made in the Apogy access control system and require executive and operations approval.  The access control system will track and record the steps in the approval process. 
            The Apogy Cloud Services environment runs on a segregated network from the corporate network and requires a separate set of credentials to be accessed. Logs are kept and reviewed for internal Apogy resources accessing the Apogy cloud services environment.
